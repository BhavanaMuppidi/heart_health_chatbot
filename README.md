# heart_health_chatbot
This heart health chatbot utilizes a decision tree algorithm to identify potential cardiac issues from user data. It provides innovative dietary and natural well-being guidance, along with valuable insights on the causes and precautions for maintaining a healthier heart.

To begin with, make sure that Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website. Once Python is set up, the next step involves installing the Flask web framework. Open your command prompt or terminal and enter the command `pip install flask` to install Flask.

After installing Flask, download all the required code files from the provided link or repository. Once downloaded, navigate to the directory where you have saved these code files using the command prompt or terminal. Within this directory, execute the `ml.py` file by running the command `python ml.py`. This execution will generate a `.pickle` file, which contains the trained machine learning model necessary for the application.

Following the successful generation of the `.pickle` file, proceed to run the `app.py` file by entering the command `python app.py` in your command prompt or terminal. This will initiate the application, and you will receive a message indicating that the server is up and running on a specific URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

To interact with the application, copy and paste the provided URL, such as `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, into your preferred web browser. By doing so, you should have access to the application interface, allowing you to utilize the machine learning model and perform the desired tasks locally on your machine. Throughout this process, ensure that you follow the steps sequentially and install any additional dependencies or libraries as specified in the code to avoid encountering any errors or issues.
